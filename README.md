This is part of a research project I completed in my final semester for my Computer Science degree

Course: DATA201

This overall goal of this group project was to scrape data from various sources around the web and wrangle the resulting data into a usable dataframe, which can be joined to other tables and/or subsequently analysed.

For my section of the project, I scraped daily COVID-19 case data from the WHO website, as well as annual health expenditure around the world from the UN data repository. The goal of this was to determine if there was any correlation between a countries response to COVID-19 and the funding level of their health system.

Data sources:

https://covid19.who.int/table

https://data.un.org/

The date that the case data was taken from is the 6/10/2020, however this can be changed to reflect current case numbers from the same data (Line 315)

This notebook must be compiled in R.
